\frametitle{Brief History}
The Lanczos algorithm was developed by Cornelius Lanczos. He developed the method while working at Boeing in the 40s. It was then forgotten for a number of years due to the lack of computers meaning that it couldn't be properly utilised. When it was then ``rediscovered" it was modified multiple times to fix some instability issues.

The Lanczos Algorithm is used to solve large scale eigenvalue problems. So give a large $n \times n$ matrix $A$ we have:
\begin{exampleblock}{Eigenvalues and eigenvectors}
\[
A v_i = \lambda_i v_i
\]
\end{exampleblock}
Where the vectors $v_i$ are the eigenvectors and the scalars $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues.
